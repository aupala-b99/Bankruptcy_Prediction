# 🏦 Bankruptcy Risk Prediction | MSBA Financial Group

Hi, I’m Aupala Bhattacharyya! This is a cloud-native portfolio project I developed as part of **GENBUS 780: Cloud Technology for Business Analytics** at the Wisconsin School of Business. The goal was to help MSBA Financial Group, a fictional investment firm, evaluate bankruptcy risk and make smarter investment decisions using AWS technologies.

## 📌 Project Overview

As an analyst for **MSBA Financial Group**, I was asked to build a scalable and automated analytics pipeline that works entirely in the AWS cloud. The objective was to use **S3**, **Glue**, **Redshift**, and **SageMaker** to ingest, process, and analyze financial data—then generate bankruptcy risk predictions and investment recommendations.

This project helped me:
- Demonstrate fluency in cloud data architecture
- Build and explain an end-to-end pipeline using only AWS tools
- Create a deployable framework for predictive analytics in finance
